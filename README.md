A Chrome Extension that enhances [Monarch Money](https://app.monarch.com) with clickable links in transaction Notes and automatic dashboard timeframe selection.

## Features

### 🔗 Links in Notes

Monarch Money's transaction drawer has a **Notes** field that accepts free-form text, including URLs — but those URLs are plain text and not clickable.

When you open a transaction, the extension scans the Notes field for URLs and injects a **Links** section directly above Notes, displaying each URL as a clickable anchor tag that opens in a new tab.

- ✅ Updates live as you type in the Notes field
- ✅ Shows nothing if Notes contains no URLs

### 📅 Auto-Select Dashboard Timeframe

The dashboard date-range dropdown defaults to a short window (e.g. "1 month"). This feature automatically selects your preferred timeframe every time you navigate to the dashboard.

- ✅ Works on hard refresh, SPA navigation, and browser back/forward
- ✅ Waits for the dropdown to become interactive before selecting
- ✅ Default: **Year to date** (configurable via the extension popup)

### ⚙️ Settings Popup

Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to configure:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Links in Notes** | Enable/disable the clickable links feature | Enabled |
| **Auto-Select Timeframe** | Enable/disable the dashboard timeframe auto-select | Enabled |
| **Default Timeframe** | Choose from: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, Year to date, 1 year, All time | Year to date |

Settings are saved via `chrome.storage.sync` and take effect immediately — no page reload required.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository to your machine.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked**.
5. Select the `MonarchMoney-Links` folder.
6. The extension is now active — navigate to any Monarch Money page to use it.
7. (Optional) Click the extension icon to configure settings.

## Usage

### Links
1. Open [Monarch Money](https://app.monarch.com) and click on any transaction.
2. In the transaction drawer, find the **Notes** field.
3. If the Notes field contains one or more URLs (e.g. `https://example.com`), a **Links** section will automatically appear just above Notes.
4. Click any link to open it in a new tab.

> **Tip:** You can mix URLs with other text in Notes — the extension will extract only the URLs.

### Dashboard Timeframe
1. Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://app.monarch.com/dashboard).
2. The date-range dropdown will automatically switch to your preferred timeframe.
3. To change the default, click the extension icon and select a different option from the **Default Timeframe** dropdown.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | Extension manifest (Manifest V3), scoped to `app.monarch.com` |
| `content.js` | Core logic — Links injection, timeframe auto-select, SPA navigation detection |
| `styles.css` | Dark-mode styles for the injected Links section |
| `popup.html` | Settings popup UI |
| `popup.css` | Dark-mode styles for the settings popup |
| `popup.js` | Settings persistence via `chrome.storage.sync` |

## Notes

- Monarch Money uses dynamically generated CSS class names that can change between app deploys. The Links feature avoids relying on these — instead, it navigates the DOM structurally (walking up from the `<textarea>`) to find the correct injection point.
- The timeframe feature uses `react-select` class names and `role="menuitem"` to interact with the dropdown. If Monarch significantly changes the dropdown component, a small update to the selectors in `content.js` may be needed.
- SPA navigation is detected via URL polling (every 500ms) as a reliable fallback, with `history.pushState`/`replaceState` patches as a fast-path.
